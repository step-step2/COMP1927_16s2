  - There is a final exam, 3 quizzes, 2 assignments, and portfolio
  - Labs are marked in the following week BUT they are due on the Sunday
    - i.e. this weeks labs are due this Sunday (using the give command), but I
      will still personally look at the code the following week WITH your partner
    - You can hand the labs in as early as you want (even on the day they are released)
      and i can check them in that weeks lab (given i have time)

  - 20 questions to do! Let's get things through ASAP

  - During Lab, we will have occasional fun, yet painful, surprise quizes
  - This will be for the first 30min of the lab, where the rest of your time
    will be dedicated to working with your partner
  - If enough people want, I can also go over something more in depth, or something i did not get
    to cover during the tutorial
  - PLEASE at a minimum, have a look over what we will be covering during the tutorial
